# DFA for recognizing strings over {a, b} that start with 'abb'

# number of states:
5

# enter transitions as space-separated list,
# Format: current_state next_state input
# Example: 0 1 a means from state 0, on input 'a', transition to state 1

0 0 abε
1 2 a
1 0 b
2 0 a
2 3 b
3 4 b
3 0 a
4 4 abε
-1

# initial state
1

# final state as space-separated list
4
